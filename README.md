# Muse-Projects
This is where I post some of the projects I worked on for the Muse EEG detecting headset.


In the 7zip compressed file included, there exists the Android Studio project

Unzip the project, and in Android Studio you can open the project via -> File -> Open Project

Bottom right button in the Main Activity opens my portion of the project
